     * Create order
     * Create a new order with HMAC signature verification and idempotency protection.
     *
     * **🔐 HMAC Signing (REQUIRED)**
     *
     * All order creation requests MUST include HMAC-SHA256 signature for security:
     *
     * 1. **Generate Timestamp**: Get current Unix timestamp in seconds
     * 2. **Create Payload**: Concatenate `timestamp + "." + JSON_body`
     * 3. **Sign Payload**: `HMAC-SHA256(hmac_secret, payload)` → base64 encode
     * 4. **Include Headers**:
     * - `X-Timestamp`: Unix timestamp (must be within 5 minutes)
     * - `X-Signature`: Base64-encoded HMAC signature
     *
     * **Example (Node.js):**
     *
     * **🔄 Idempotency Protection**
     *
     * Include `Idempotency-Key` header to prevent duplicate orders on retry.
     * If the same key is used, the original order is returned (not counted against rate limit).
     *
     * **⚠️ Security Notes:**
     * - HMAC secret is displayed in the Integrations page (Developer section)
     * - Never expose HMAC secret in client-side code
     * - Regenerate secret immediately if compromised
     * - Requests with invalid/missing signatures return 401 Unauthorized
     * - Timestamps older than 5 minutes are rejected to prevent replay attacks
     *
     * **🛡️ Server-side price validation (anti-tampering)**
     *
     * HMAC proves the body wasn't altered in transit; it does **not** prove the amounts are honest.
     * So the server independently recomputes the order from authoritative data and rejects any
     * mismatch — you cannot set your own prices or discounts:
     *
     * - **Item prices** are recomputed from the live catalog. `unit_price` / `total_price` that don't
     * match the catalog price → **`400 price_mismatch`**. (The stored order always uses the catalog
     * price, never the value you send.)
     * - **`subtotal`, `tax_amount`, `total_amount`** must reconcile to `subtotal + tax + shipping −
     * discount` over those catalog prices → otherwise **`400 price_mismatch`**.
     * - **`tax_amount`** is calculated by the server when you omit it: for the `shipping_address` when
     * the store has automatic tax (the shipping charge is rated as its own line), otherwise at the
     * store's own rate — on the line totals, plus the shipping charge when the store charges tax on
     * shipping. At the store's own rate a `tax_amount` you send must match that figure to the cent →
     * otherwise **`400 price_mismatch`**. When the store's prices include tax, the tax is taken from
     * what the shopper pays (line totals − discount, plus shipping when taxed) and `subtotal` is the
     * line totals minus that tax. `POST /v1/tax/preview` returns the same figure before checkout.
     * - **`discount_amount`** is validated against the discount the promotions / gift card you claim
     * actually grant (computed server-side from `promotion_usages` + `gift_card_redemption`). A
     * `discount_amount` greater than that legitimate maximum → **`400 discount_invalid`**. A discount
     * with no real promotion/gift card behind it → max is `0`. (You may apply *less* than the maximum.)
     * - **`shipping_amount`** is checked on every order, $0 included, and may not be negative:
     * - With a carrier option (`shipping_rate_id` + `shipping_rate_source`, or `shippo_rate_id`),
     * the option is fetched again from its source — the store's carrier account, or its custom
     * shipping extension re-quoted for `shipping_address` and `shipping_parcel`. An unknown,
     * expired or foreign option, one in another currency, or a test-mode option on a live order →
     * **`400 shipping_rate_invalid`**; an amount that differs from the option →
     * **`400 price_mismatch`**.
     * - Otherwise, when the store has delivery rates and the destination is known
     * (`shipping_latitude`/`shipping_longitude`, or a `shipping_address` that can be located), the
     * amount must equal the store's charge for that address, free-delivery thresholds measured
     * against the line totals after `discount_amount` → otherwise **`400 price_mismatch`**. A
     * destination the store does not deliver to → **`400 shipping_not_deliverable`**.
     * - A store with no delivery rates (it ships through its own arrangements) accepts the amount
     * sent; so does an order whose destination cannot be located. Such an order is recorded as
     * not checked.
     * - When shipping cannot be checked because the service is unreachable →
     * **`502 shipping_unavailable`**; the order is not created.
     *
     * In short: send the **real catalog prices** and the **actual promotions/gift card** the shopper is
     * entitled to. Don't compute or invent prices/discounts client-side — the server is the authority.
     *
     * @returns Order The `Idempotency-Key` has already been used for this store, so the order it created is
     * returned instead of a new one being made. The body is the order resource, exactly as
     * `GET /v1/orders/{id}` would return it — note this differs from the `201` envelope, which
     * nests the order under an `order` property.
     *
     * Retrying a create with the same key is always safe: concurrent retries resolve to the
     * same order, and only the first request receives `201`.
     *

    /**
     * Update order
     * Update specific fields of an existing order with HMAC signature verification and idempotency protection.
     *
     * **🔐 HMAC Signing (REQUIRED)**
     *
     * All order update requests MUST include HMAC-SHA256 signature:
     *
     * 1. **Generate Timestamp**: Get current Unix timestamp in seconds
     * 2. **Create Payload**: Concatenate `timestamp + "." + JSON_body`
     * 3. **Sign Payload**: `HMAC-SHA256(hmac_secret, payload)` → base64 encode
     * 4. **Include Headers**:
     * - `X-Timestamp`: Unix timestamp (must be within 5 minutes)
     * - `X-Signature`: Base64-encoded HMAC signature
     *
     * **🔄 Idempotency Protection**
     *
     * Include `Idempotency-Key` header to prevent duplicate updates on retry.
     * Each PATCH operation is tracked separately - if you retry with the same key,
     * the original order state is returned without re-processing side effects.
     *
     * **Important:** Use a unique idempotency key for each distinct update operation.
     * - ✅ Good: `update-shipping-{order_id}-{timestamp}`, `mark-paid-{order_id}-{timestamp}`
     * - ❌ Bad: Reusing the same key for different updates to the same order
     *
     * This prevents duplicate processing of critical operations like:
     * - Double-triggering accounting entries when marking as paid
     * - Re-reducing inventory stock
     * - Duplicate gift card redemptions
     * - Multiple promotion usage recordings
     *
     * **Updatable Fields:**
     * - `payment_status`: Payment status (pending, paid, failed)
     * - `order_status`: Order fulfillment status (pending, confirmed, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
     * - `notes`: Additional order notes
     * - `tracking_number`: Shipping tracking number
     * - `estimated_delivery`: Estimated delivery date/time
     * - `shipped_at`: Timestamp when order was shipped
     * - `delivered_at`: Timestamp when order was delivered
     *
     * **Status transitions:**
     * - `payment_status`: `pending` → `paid` or `failed`; `failed` → `paid`. A `paid` order
     * does not move back, and `refunded` is set by processing a refund, not by this endpoint.
     * - `order_status` moves forward only (`pending` → `confirmed` → `processing` → `shipped` →
     * `delivered`). `cancelled` is available until the order ships. `cancelled` and `delivered`
     * are final, and a cancelled order cannot be marked paid.
     * - Sending a field with the value it already has is not a transition: the request succeeds
     * and nothing is repeated. Any other move is refused with `409 invalid_transition`.
     * - A status change applies only if the order is still in the state it was in when the
     * request began. When two requests change it at once, one succeeds and the other receives
     * `409 order_changed`.
     *
     * **Automatic Accounting:**
     * When `payment_status` is updated to `paid`, the system automatically, and once:
     * - Triggers accounting entry creation (production only)
     * - Reduces inventory stock for all order items, committing the order's own stock holds
     * - Updates customer purchase metrics
     * - Redeems the gift card applied at checkout (if applicable)
     * - Records promotion usage and campaign spend (if applicable)
     * Anything that does not complete is listed in `post_processing_warnings` on the response; the
     * order stays paid.
     *
     * When an unpaid order is cancelled or its payment fails, its stock holds are released and any
     * store credit applied to it is returned to the customer.
     *
     * **Key Type Support:**
     * - ✅ Secret keys (full access)
     * - ❌ Publishable keys (forbidden - returns 403)
     *
     * @returns any Order updated successfully
